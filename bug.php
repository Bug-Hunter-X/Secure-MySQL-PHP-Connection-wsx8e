This code snippet demonstrates a common issue in PHP related to using the `mysql_*` functions, which are now deprecated and insecure.  It attempts to connect to a MySQL database, but it lacks proper error handling, making it vulnerable to various issues. 
```php
<?php
$link = mysql_connect('localhost', 'user', 'password');
if (!$link) {
    die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error());
}
echo 'Connected successfully';
mysql_close($link);
?>
```
The `mysql_error()` function only returns the last error that occurred which is unreliable. Also, no parameterization is used, leaving the code open to SQL injection.
